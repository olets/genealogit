# What's this?
genealogit uses Git as a family tree modelling and visualization tool.

`genealogit build <file>` reads data from a file and for each person creates a single-commit branch.

`genealogit visualize <file>` shows the `git log --graph` for the branches (must run `genealogit build <file>` first).

`genealogit relationship <file> <individual 1's id> <individual 2's id>` reports the blood relationship between two individuals (must run `genealogit build <file>` first).

`genealogit clean <file>` deletes the branches created by `genealogit build <file>`.

The **data file** can be GEDCOM (.ged), JSON, or YAML. If making your own `.json` or `.yaml`, you can follow GEDCOM or take advantage of genealogit's support for the non-standard properties `name` and `parentIds`. For example, a simple YAML could look like

```yaml
- individuals
  - id: 1
    name: child
    parentIds:
      - 2
      - 3
  - id: 2
    name: parent_1
  - id: 3
    name: parent_2
```

**Branch names** are

```
genealogit/<file>/<individual id>
```

**Commit messages** are

```
<individual's full name> (<individual's id>)

<individual's full record>
```

The **commit author** for all commits created by genealogit is `genealogit <genealogit@olets.dev>`.

It's all just Git, so you can do anything you would in any Git repo
- See a person's full record with, for example, `git log -1 genealogit/<file>/<id>`.
- See the line of relation between two people with, for example,

    ```shell
    git log --oneline genealogit/<file>/<ancestor's id>..genealogit/<file>/<descendant's id>
    ```
- Operate on all branches built from a file by, for example, leveraging `git for-each-ref`. For example push a family tree with
    ```shell
    for branch in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/genealogit/<file>); do git push -u <upstream> $branch; done
    ```

# Quickstart

At a minimum, genealogit **requires** that you are in a Git repo with **at least one commit**. You Git repo can have a lot of other things going on too. Install genealogit as an Node package dependency. The minimum setup is:

```shell
mkdir my-family-tree
cd my-family-tree
git init
git commit --allow-empty -m "empty"
(yarn init | npm init)
(yarn add genealogit | npm install genealogit)
```

Add a family tree file to the directory. If you don't have one, download and play with one or all of the files in `demo/` directory. (Or download others at for example <https://webtreeprint.com/tp_famous_gedcoms.php>). The following supposes a GEDCOM file. If the file is JSON use `build --format=json` in the `build`. If the file is YAML `build --format=yaml`.

```shell
(npx | yarn) genealogit build a-family-tree.ged
(npx | yarn) genealogit visualize a-family-tree.ged
(npx | yarn) genealogit relationship a-family-tree.ged <an id> <another id>
```

# Acknowledgments

genealogit relies on [gedcom-js](https://github.com/stivaugoin/gedcom-js) to parse GEDCOM. That project is also the source of the `potter.ged` demo file.
